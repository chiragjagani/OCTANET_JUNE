### Task 1: Basic Landing Page Creation

**Description:** Each intern is required to create a basic landing page on a topic of their choice. The landing page should be simple yet engaging, 
focusing on the following aspects:
  You can use any web development tools or frameworks you are comfortable with. However, you should focus on using basic HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript for this task.
  It is important to pay attention to the alignment, the padding, the color palette, and boxes. Make sure CSS doesnâ€™t overlap elements.
  Upon completion of your landing page project, you must provide a link to your hosted landing page on GitHub..
